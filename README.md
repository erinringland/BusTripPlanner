# Winnipeg Transit Trip Planner

For this app, I developed it for a final class assignment in our Third Party APIs Intro section. This app consists of two Third Party APIs, The City of Winnipeg Public Transit API and MapBox API. It takes two locations the user inputed and displays the steps (walking distance, bus stop number, transfers, Bus(es)) needed to get from the origin point to the destination.

To use the app, the user must input the origin point and then the destination desired. Once a valid origin point and destination point are added, result will be displayed to the user. If there are multiple trip options, it will be displayed by chronological order by departure time from the origin point.
